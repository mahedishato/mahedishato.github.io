                        images to detect the presence of tumors. The dataset consists of MRI scans categorized into two classes: images without tumors and images with tumors.
                        The CNN model is constructed with multiple layers, including Conv2D for convolutional operations, MaxPooling2D for down-sampling, Activation layers for 
                        non-linear transformations, Dropout for regularization to prevent overfitting, and Dense layers for the final classification. The images are preprocessed 
                        to a uniform input size, and the model is trained over several epochs with continuous monitoring of training and validation loss to evaluate performance.
                        The sample output image clearly indicates the presence of a tumor, underscoring the model's efficacy. This project exemplifies
